<div class='intro'><p><span class='whiteout'><%=company_name%> builds joyful products.</span><br /> Of prime importance is surrounding ourselves with clients and collaborators who share that passion and who bring their own diverse abilities to bear on it. We&#39;re optimistic about the prospects for society-enhancing progress. <span class='whiteout'>Here&#39;s why&hellip;</span></p></div>
<h1>Life on the Farm</h1>
<p><a href='http://www.att.com'>AT&amp;T&#39;s</a> monopoly and the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_bells'>Baby Bells&#39;</a> subsequent oligopoly stifled telecommunications innovation for almost a century. Sure, the US public benefitted from <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_service'>Universal Service</a>, but at what price? Similarly, <a href='http://www.microsoft.com'>Microsoft&#39;s</a> operating system monopoly stifled innovation for almost two decades. And for what benefit? The public, like cattle, tended by these huge corporations, is fed just enough to keep it nominally productive and calm so that the maximum output can be extracted&mdash;in dollars.</p>
<p>Well in some ways this is old news. The Web makes the operating system much less important. Oh you still need one, but just about any old one will do, provided it supports <a href='http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/'>Firefox</a>. And look at those old phone companies, falling over one-another to be the <a href='http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/breaking/verizon-says-it-will-open-network-to-any-apps-any-device-in-2008-326797.php'>firstest</a> to be the <a href='http://www.engadget.com/2007/12/06/atandt-claims-completely-open-network-too-the-most-open-eve/'>openest</a>.</p>

<h1>Out of the Corral and Onto the Truck</h1>
<p>While there is great cause for optimism, a new set of dangers faces the public. While in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s we may have suffered retarded innovation at the hands of <a href='http://www.microsoft.com'>Microsoft</a>&mdash;at least our data was stored on our own disks. If worse came to worst we could at least access it (even if we couldn&#39;t actually <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#File_formats'>repurpose</a> it). The Web era changes that. We face the very real possibility that a new group of very large corporations will soon not only control the applications we use every day, but also they'll control all access to our data as well. The desktop era of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> versus <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> has been superseded by Web era of <a href='http://google.com'>Google</a> versus <a href='http://facebook.com'>Facebook</a> versus Everybody Else.</p>

<h1>Livestock Revolt</h1>
<p>We stand now at a crossroad. One path leads to another cycle of stifled innovation, of a few corporations enriching a few fat cats at the public&#39;s expense. The other way, leads to a new corporate ecosystem&mdash;a system of thousands of service and technology providers&mdash;an open system where millions can share in the wealth and from which the public will reap the benefits of innovation in real time.</p>
