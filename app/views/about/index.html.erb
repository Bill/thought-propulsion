<h3>Islands&mdash;A Nice Place to Visit But a Bad Place to be Marooned</h3>
<p>Applications are islands. Platforms are islands. The desktop era of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> versus <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> has been superseded by Web era of <a href='http://google.com'>Google</a> versus <a href='http://facebook.com'>Facebook</a> versus Everybody Else.</p>

<p>The desktop <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/games/kid-games/monopoly/">monopoly</a> inflated prices. Worse than that&mdash;it stifled innovation. Now, while we paid more for less, at least we retained some control over our information&mdash;it was stored on our own disks. The Web era changes everything. We face the very real possibility that a small group of very large corporations will soon control not only the applications we use every day, but also our data as well.</p>

<h3>Your web&mdash;Your way</h3>

<p>We stand now at a crossroad. One way leads to another 20 years of stifled innovation, of a few corporations enriching a few fat cats at our expense. The other way, leads to a new corporate ecosystem&mdash;a system of thousands of service and technology providers&mdash;an open system where millions can share in the wealth and you can reap the benefits of innovation in real time.</p>

<p>Thought Propulsion delivers Web applications for this innovative future&mdash;applications that put you in the center of the picture. Rather than locking you in to a platform, Thought Propulsion applications work seamlessly with your other applications&mdash;from other vendors. When we say your data is yours&mdash;we don&apos;t just mean you can export it whenever you want&mdash;we mean you can leverage that data across multiple vendor products as you see fit.</p>

<p>We aren&apos;t alone in this quest&mdash;we join hundreds of other up and coming ventures&mdash;companies and individuals who are challenging outdated axioms to bring you your web, your way.</p>
