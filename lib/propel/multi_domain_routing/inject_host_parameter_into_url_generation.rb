# Rails suggests that we users extend route recognition by providing our own 
# RouteSet#extract_request_environment and Route#recognition_conditions. 
# That's a really nice extension point. It lets us extend routing conditions
# to more than just :method. Stuff like :host and :scheme etc.
# But then Rails ignores those extensions when constructing URL's internally.
# See how url_rewriter.rb UrlRewriter#rewrite_path sends 
# @request.symbolized_path_parameters to Routing::Routes.generate, 
# but the request got its path_parameters from RouteSet#recognize here:
#   def recognize(request)
#     params = recognize_path(request.path, extract_request_environment(request))
#     request.path_parameters = params.with_indifferent_access
#     â€¦
# What this little patch does is intervenes on the setting of Request 
# path_parameters, injecting the extra parameters gleaned from 
# extract_request_environment. In a vanilla Rails environment this gives you
# :method but in a user-extension scenario you get all the user-defined goodness.
