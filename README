Rails 2.1.0 (Gems) plus a number of other gems (run rake gems to see the list and rake gems:install to install them).

open_id_authentication  - name says it all
request_routing         - * patched * version of Dan Webb's request_routing (I added :host condition)
seed-fu                 - defines rake task for initializing database data "rake db:seed"

In development and test these are used:

rspec
rspec-rails
